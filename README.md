# 🚀 NLP Model Training & Inference Project

> ⚠️ **Project Status**: In Progress  
> This project is not yet complete. Some manual steps are required to run or train the model.

---

## 📥 Requirements

To run this project, you will need to **download the pre-trained model and its tokenizer** manually.

### 🔗 Downloads

- **Model & Tokenizer**  
  [📁 Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-Wha_doXW39ijTUQHWuXKkshOLLY4y9v?usp=drive_link)

- **Dataset (700,000+ Rows)**  
  The same folder also contains a large dataset you can use to train or fine-tune the model.

---

## 🧠 Train Your Own Model

You’ll find a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) in the folder that contains everything you need to:
- Preprocess the dataset  
- Train a new model  
- Evaluate performance  
- Upload the trained model to Google Drive

---

## 📂 Folder Contents

- `model/` – Pre-trained model files (to be downloaded)  
- `tokenizer/` – Tokenizer files (to be downloaded)  
- `dataset.csv` – Dataset with 700k+ rows  
- `train_model.ipynb` – Notebook to train, test, and save your model

---

## 📌 Notes

- Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed (e.g., `transformers`, `datasets`, `torch`, etc.)
- You must place the downloaded model and tokenizer in the correct directories as referenced in the notebook.

---

## ✅ Next Steps

- [ ] Automate download of model/tokenizer
- [ ] Add CLI or web interface for inference
- [ ] Improve training pipeline
